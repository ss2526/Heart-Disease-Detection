Random Forest
XGBoost
Deep Learning Model: Neural Network

Import the libraries and reading and understanding the DataSet
First, we need to import the libraries which are used for this "Heart Disease Prediction".


import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
     
Now, we will read the Dataset using pandas where we given alias name as pd


df=pd.read_csv("/content/heart.csv")
     

df.shape #to find no.of rows and columns
     
(303, 14)
The dataset contains 14 attributes. Lets breifly learn about

Each attribute

Its unique features

Visualizing it using seaborn and matplot libraries.

As we are applying supervised Machine Learning models, here my Target attribute acts as a dependent variable and rest of the attributes are independent variables.

Target: This attribute contains 0's and 1's where 1 indicates a person is suffering with heart disease and 0 indicates absence of heart disease.


target_count = df.target.value_counts()

4.Resting Blood Pressure: Having high blood pressure can be detrimental, as it can damage the arteries that supply blood to the heart. If high blood pressure is accompanied by other health conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, the risk is even higher.

This attribute contains the resting blood pressure value of every person in mmHg(unit).

5.Serum Cholestrol:Having a high amount of LDL cholesterol can lead to clogged arteries, whereas having a high amount of triglycerides, which are associated with diet, increases the risk of a heart attack. On the other hand, having a high level of HDL cholesterol, which is beneficial, reduces the risk of a heart attack.

This attribute contains the serum Cholestrol of every person in mg/dl(unit).

6.Fasting Blood Sugar:Having insufficient insulin secretion or an inability to effectively utilize insulin from your pancreas can cause your blood sugar levels to rise, putting you at greater risk of having a heart attack.

This attributes compares Fasting Blood Sugar value of every person with 120mg/dl. This attribute contains 0's and 1's, where 1 indicates fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl and 0 indicates fasting blood sugar <= 120mg/dl.

10.ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest: ST depression induced by exercise refers to a decrease in the ST segment of the ECG (electrocardiogram) compared to the ST segment of the ECG at rest. This decrease is typically seen during exercise stress tests and is a sign of myocardial ischemia, which is a decrease in blood flow to the heart caused by an occlusion in the coronary arteries.

11.Peak exercise ST segment: ak exercise ST segment is a measurement of electrical activity in the heart during exercise. It is measured by an electrocardiogram and is used to detect signs of ischemia, or reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. During exercise, the ST segment may become elevated, flattened, or depressed, which can indicate a decrease in blood flow to the heart.

Performance measures
Performance measures: Performance measures are essential metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning algorithm. Performance measures are used to compare the performance of different models on a given data set and to determine which model provides the best results. Performance measures can be used to identify areas in which the model can be improved and to determine the overall accuracy of the model.

There are four machine learning classification model performance measures:

Accuracy Score

Precision Score

Recall Score

F1-Score

Accuracy Score:Accuracy Score is one of the most commonly used performance measures in machine learning. It is used to measure how accurately a model can predict the expected output. It is calculated by taking the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. A higher accuracy score indicates that the model is more accurate in predicting the expected output.

Accuracy Score = (TP + TN)/ (TP + FN + TN + FP)

Precision Score:Precision score is a performance measure used in machine learning to evaluate the accuracy of a modelâ€™s predictions. It is a measure of the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Precision score is typically expressed as a percentage, with a higher percentage indicating a better model performance.

Precision Score = TP / (FP + TP)

Recall Score:Recall Score is a performance measure used in machine learning that evaluates a modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify relevant instances from a dataset. It is calculated by dividing the number of relevant instances correctly identified by the total number of relevant instances in the dataset. The higher the recall score, the better the performance of the model.

Recall Score = TP / (FN + TP)

F1-Score:F1-score is a performance measure in machine learning that combines precision and recall into a single metric. It is often used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, as it takes both false positives and false negatives into account. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where the best value is 1.0 and the worst value is 0.0. A model which has a high F1-score is considered to be a better model than one with a low F1-score. The F1-score is often used in conjunction with other performance measures such as accuracy, precision and recall.The F1-score is a good measure of a modelâ€™s performance when there is an uneven class distribution. This is because it takes both false positives and false negatives into account, and gives more weight to the minority class. The F1-score is also useful when there is a need to weigh precision and recall equally.

F1 Score = (2* Precision Score * Recall Score) / (Precision Score + Recall Score)

Decision Tree:Decision Trees are a supervised machine learning tool used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a type of algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions by breaking down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. The decision nodes have a certain condition or attribute associated with them, and the leaf nodes represent class labels or class distributions.
